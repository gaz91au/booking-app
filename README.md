# Booking App

The idea of this project is to be a simple booking management app that i would come back to from time to time when i get an itch to try new tools and technologies.

Initially inspired by [eShopsOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers), i will try to attempt an advanced domain driven design and simple cqrs approach
